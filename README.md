# Master-Thesis---Safe-and-Secure-LLM
Conducted a comparative analysis of Llama 2–7B Chat and Mistral 7B-Instruct, evaluating their responses and safety guardrails across diverse prompts.

Used 4-bit quantization for efficient inference and a custom autistic-friendly prompt framework with robust input/output scanning for safety.

Identified key differences in model interpretation, especially on sensitive and high-risk topics, highlighting gaps in built-in safeguards.

Demonstrated the importance of custom safety filters for responsible AI deployment, aligning findings with current research on LLM safety, security, and adversarial risks.
